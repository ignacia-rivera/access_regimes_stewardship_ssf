## 2.	High- and low-performance categorization of sampled fishers' associations 

To categorize associations into high and low-management TURF performance we use the social integration and management capacity portion of the co-management performance index built by Marin et al., 2012. **Table S1** describes de variables included, their scale and justification. 

**Table S2** present the values for the different associations in our sample as assessed by Marin et al., 2012 (database provided by the author). We estimated a TURF management performance index using the average score of the included variables. To define the cutoff at which an association will be considered a high- or low-performance we calculated the median value in the whole sample of Marin et al., 2012, which was equal to 2.13. All associations with performance index greater than 2.13 were considered high-performance associations and those smaller than 2.13 were considered low-performance associations. We then sampled from both types of associations to build our sample.

Red values indicate those values under the cutoff of 2.13 (the median value in Marin et al. 2012) and green values indicate those above the cutoff.](C:/Users/Ignacia Rivera/Desktop/tax/Table_S2.png)


## 2.	Instructions of the Common-pool resource game 

Welcome, and thank you for being here. You have been randomly chosen from the list of members of your fishers' association to participate in a game. This research is concerned with fishing of loco/hake. It is part of a project carried on jointly Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and the Research Center in Social Complexity from the Universidad del Desarrollo. Your association's board, and National fisheries authorities like the National Service of Fisheries and Aquaculture (SERNAPESCA) and The Undersecretary of Fisheries (SUBPESCA) are not involved in this study. The game will last around an hour. By participating you could earn up to $32.500 CLP each. Once the session ends you will receive your payoffs individually and privately.

Now we will read the instructions aloud. If you have any questions, please rise your hand in silence and we will answer them aloud.

You will play the game via computers. Do not worry if you have never used a computer before since we will only be using the numeric keypad, which Works very similar to the numeric keypad in a cellphone or a calculator. Before starting the game, the ten participants in the room will be randomly assembled in two groups of five fishers each. All the interaction with your partners will be perform anonymously via the computer. You will never know who the other members of your group were, neither during the game nor after it.

The game recreates a situation in which you go out harvesting/fishing for loco/hake and need to decide individually how many locos/kilos of hake to harvest/fish. The game is divided into 20 rounds, which represent fishing trips. Each one of you has an individual quota of 100 locos/kilos of hake per round, which was established by the association's board/SUBPESCA --- this is just a recreation given that the association's board/SUBPESCA is not really involved in this study. The computer will always assume that you will harvest all the locos/kilos of hake from your individual quota. In addition, you will have the chance to harvest/fish up to 50 more units above your quota in each round. Harvest/fish more locos/kilos of hake than the quota established by the association's board/SUBPESCA brings more economic benefits to you, but it produces economic harm to the other members in your group. This is because for every two locos/kilos of hake you overharvest/overfish the other members in your group will lose one loco/kilo of hake each from their individual catch. This mimics the damage that overharvesting/overfishing generates over the marine ecosystem reducing everyone's' productivity.

Now, we will show you the screens that you will see in the computer during the game. In each round the computer will ask the same question: How many locos/kilos of hake above your individual quota you want to harvest/fish (from 0 up to 50)? If you want to comply with your quota, the answer must be zero. To answer, you should use the numbers in the keypad and then press the red button. If you would like to change your answer, use the "X" button to delete, and if you get an error message because you have entered and invalid number, use the "OK" button to go back to the decision screen.

Your answers will be recorded anonymously in the computer. Neither the researches, nor the other participants will know how many locos/kilos of hake did you harvest/fish during the game. Your identity will never be revealed. To remain anonymous, it is very important to remain in silence during the game and no make any comments. It is not allowed to speak during the game, if you need any help please rise your hand in silence and a monitor will assist you.  Once every group's member had entered their responses, you will see a summary screen, summarizing the results of the round. As you can see, it will tell you:


* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you harvested/fished in that round. 
* The number of locos/kilos of hake harvested/fished, on average, by the rest of the members in your group in that round.
* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you lost due to the overharvesting/overfishing of the other members of your group in that round. 
* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you ended up with and are available to be sold in that round. * The amount of money that you earned in that round.

Once you have read the screen press the red button to continue. Once everyone has read their screens, the next round will automatically begin.

Summarizing:

* You have an individual quota of 100 locos/kilos of hake in each round. 
* You have the chance of harvest/fish beyond your quota up to 50 additional locos/kilos of hake in each round.
* For each additional loco/kilo of hake you overharvest/overfish the rest of the members in your group will lose half a loco/kilo of hake from their catch in that round. 
* We will pay you $10 CLP for each loco/kilo of hake at the end of each round.
* Your earnings will be accumulated during the 20 rounds of the game and will be paid privately at the end of the session.

Before starting you will play three trial rounds just to practice. These rounds are not for real money. Please rise your hand in silence if you have any question and wait until a monitor can assist you. Once the trial rounds are completed, the real game will start, and you will be playing for real money.

Please remember that communication during the game is not allowed!

*At the beginning of the 11th round:*

Starting from the eleven round a new rule will be implemented. After everyone have decided how many locos/kilos of hake they want to overharvest/overfish, the computer will randomly match two players in each group. One person in each of the couples formed by the computer, will be assigned as the "observer" and will be allowed to observe their partner's catch without knowing their identity. Since the groups have five players, two persons in each group will be "observers", two will be observed and one person will remain inactive during this stage. The computer will randomly assign the roles in each round.

If you are randomly chosen as an "observer", you will see a screen that we will show you your partner's catch.  It is like you could see how many locos/kilos of hake the other fisher has in her or his boat. If your partner has exceeded her or his quota, you will have the chance of reporting she or he to the association's board/SERNAPESCA --- again this is just a recreation given that the association's board/SERNAPESCA is not really involved in this study. If you are selected as an observer, \$250 CLP will be added to your account. You can use them to report your partner if she or he has exceeded their quota. If you do not spend the \$250 CLP in reporting your partner, they will be accumulated in your account. If the association's board/SERNAPESCA is informed about a quota violation, it will punish the offender by seizing all their catch for that round, leaving that fisher with zero locos/kilos of hake.In the game, the computer will play the role of the association's board/SERNAPESCA. Since the game is anonymous, no one will really know who exceeded their individual quota.

If you are assigned the role of "observed" the screen will let you know that your catch is being observed by other fisher, and you should wait in silence for the next screen.

If you have been selected to remain inactive during this stage, it means you do not observe anyone's catch nor will someone observe yours. The screen will ask you to wait in silence for the next screen.

After "observers" have decided whether to report, everyone will see a summary screen. As you can see, it will tell you: 

* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you harvested/fished in that round. 
* The number of locos/kilos of hake harvested/fished, on average, by the rest of the members in your group in that round.
* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you lost because of the overharvesting/overfishing of the other members of your group in that round. 
* Whether you have been reported to the association's board/SERNAPESCA and your catch has been seized in that round. 
* The number of locos/kilos of hake that you ended up with and are available to be sold in that round.
* The amount of money that you earned in that round.  Once everyone had read their results, the next round will start.

Summarizing:

* You have an individual quota of 100 locos/kilos of hake in each round. 
* You have the chance of harvest/fish beyond your quota up to 50 additional locos/kilos of hake in each round.
* For each additional loco/kilo of hake you overharvest/overfish the rest of the members in your group will lose half a loco/kilo of hake from their catch in that round. 
* After everyone have entered their decisions, the computer will randomly assign two players as "observers", two as "observed", and one will remain inactive in each round. Each "observer" will see the catch of an "observed".
* If the "observer" sees that the "observed" has exceed her or his quota, she or he can decide whether to report it to the association's board/SERNAPESCA. The "observer" will receive $250 CLP in her or his account that can be spent in reporting a quota violation. If the "observer" does not use the \$250 CLP for reporting, they will be accumulated in her or his account.  
* The association's board will seize all the catch of a reported offender, including their individual quota. 
* We will pay you $10 CLP for each loco/kilo of hake at the end of each round.
* Your earnings will be accumulated during the 20 rounds of the game and will be paid privately at the end of the session. 

Before starting you will play three trial rounds just to practice. These rounds are not for real money. Please rise your hand in silence if you have any question and wait until a monitor can assist you. Once the trial rounds are completed, the real game will start, and you will be playing for real money.

Please remember that communication during the game is not allowed!

## 3.	Linear regressions models of the mean group quota compliance over round for each frame-stage combination. 

To assess the evolution of compliance over rounds in each frame-stage combination we regressed group compliance as a percent over round, clustering standard errors by group. A significant negative effect of the variable round over group compliance was interpreted as erosion of compliance. Table S3 and S4 show results of the linear regression models for each frame-stage combination for high-performance and low-performance associations, respectively.
