# access_regimes_stewardship_ssf

This repository contains data and code used to generate the manuscript "Exploring the role of access regimes over internalized  stewardship behaviors of small-scale fishers". Here follows an overview of the folders in this repository:

1. Data: stores the raw database called "DB_fishers.csv", which is the output from our experiment. In addition, it stores the intermediate databases generated for data analysis.

2. Scripts: contains two .Rmd documents. One runs the code to generate the final manuscript, called "access_regimes_stewardship_code..Rmd" and the other one contains the code to generate the supporting information for the manuscript, called "si_access_regimes_stewardship_code.Rmd"

3. PDFs: contains the .pdf documents for the manuscript and the supporting information.
